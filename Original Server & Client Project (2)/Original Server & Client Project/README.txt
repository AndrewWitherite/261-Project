TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:
1. Right click the Server.java file from the project directory, then click 'Run File'    
   This will start up the server, which will sit and wait for a client to connect to it before it does anything else
2. Right click the Controller.java file from the project directory, then click 'Run File' on that as well
   This will create a client that looks to connect to a server with the same socket, which should already be running from Step 1.

In the console, you can see that there are 2 builds running (the server and client), click through them to see full funcionality.
